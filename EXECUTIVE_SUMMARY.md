## CRITICAL GAPS - MUST FIX 🔴

### 1. User Experience (Currently 5/10)

**Current Problem:** App looks and feels generic, like a calculator from 2015
- Minimal visual design
- Text-heavy results (no charts/graphs)
- Confusing input forms
- No onboarding tutorial
- No results export

**Impact:** Users will choose competitor apps (which look better)

**Fix:** Professional UI/UX redesign (1 week)
- Modern Material Design 3 look
- Dark mode support
- Interactive charts for results
- Export to PDF/Email
- 5-step guided wizard

### 2. Documentation (Currently 1/10)

**Current Problem:** README has 1 line, no API docs, no user guide

**Impact:** 
- Developers can't contribute
- Users confused about features
- Play Store listing incomplete
- Impossible to maintain long-term

**Fix:** Complete documentation (3-4 days)
- 5-page README
- Full API documentation
- User guide with screenshots
- Architecture documentation
- FAQ section

### 3. Market Differentiation (Currently 5/10)

**Current Problem:** Same features as 3 competitors, but worse UI

**Impact:** No reason for users to choose THIS app over alternatives

**Fix:** Add unique features (1-2 weeks)
- Visual comparison (multi-madhab side-by-side)
- Learning content (Islamic explanations)
- Offline access to all madhabs
- Family tree builder
- Result sharing to WhatsApp/Email
