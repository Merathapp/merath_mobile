# Merath FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Merath?

Merath is a professional-grade Islamic inheritance calculator built with React Native. It accurately calculates heir distributions according to Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh) across multiple Islamic schools (Madhabs).

### Is it free?

Yes, Merath is completely free to download and use. No hidden charges or in-app purchases.

### What platforms does it support?

- **Mobile**: iOS 12+, Android 6.0+
- **Web**: All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Is my data secure?

Yes. All calculations are performed locally on your device. No data is sent to any server. Your privacy is our priority.

## Calculation Questions

### How accurate are the calculations?

Merath uses fraction-based arithmetic for exact calculations, not decimal approximations. This ensures perfect accuracy to the last penny, regardless of estate size.

### Which Islamic schools does it support?

- Hanafi
- Maliki
- Shafii
- Hanbali

### What is the Hijab system?

Hijab (حجاب) means "veil" or "screen" in Islamic law. It refers to certain heirs being completely or partially excluded from inheritance due to the presence of other heirs. For example:
- A grandson is completely excluded if a son exists
- A daughter's share is reduced if sons exist

### Can I calculate for complex family situations?

Yes! Merath handles:
- Multiple spouses
- Full and half-siblings
- Predeceased heirs
- Complex grandfather/grandmother situations
- Extended family relationships

### What if there are bequests?

Merath deducts bequests before calculating inheritance shares:

```
Distribution = Total - Debts - Funeral - Bequests
```

Specific bequests are honored first, then remaining divided among heirs.

### How are fractions displayed?

Shares are displayed as both:
- **Fractions**: e.g., "1/8" (exact)
- **Percentage**: e.g., "12.5%" (for reference)
- **Amount**: e.g., "$12,500" (actual money)
